</p>

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiplayer-chess-app.git
cd multiplayer-chess-app
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_url
```

> Replace `your_secret` and `your_postgres_url` with your own credentials.

### 4. Database Setup

This app uses **PostgreSQL** for persistent data (users, games, match history) and **Prisma** as the ORM.

- Ensure PostgreSQL is installed and running.
- Create a database (e.g., `chess_app_db`).
- Update your `.env`:

  ```
  DATABASE_URL="postgresql://USER:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/chess_app_db"
  ```

  Replace `USER`, `PASSWORD`, and `chess_app_db` as needed.

#### Install Prisma and Client Libraries

```bash
npm install @prisma/client
npm install --save-dev prisma
npm install pg
```

#### Initialize Prisma

```bash
npx prisma init
```
### 5. Run the Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 6. Test Multiplayer Locally

Open multiple browser tabs and navigate to:

```
http://localhost:3000/game/vs-player/room1
```

Each tab will be assigned a color (White/Black) or Spectator mode automatically.
